\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
We have seen that to typeset something in \LaTeX, we type in the text to be typeset together with some \LaTeX\ commands. Words must be separated by spaces (does not matter how many) and lines maybe broken arbitrarily.

The end of a paragraph is specified by a \emph{blank line} in the input. In other words, whenever you want to start a new paragraph, just leave a blank line and proceed.
