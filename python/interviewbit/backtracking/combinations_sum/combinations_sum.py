Combination Sum

Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

 Note:
 All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
 Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak).
 The combinations themselves must be sorted in ascending order.
 CombinationA > CombinationB iff (a1 > b1) OR (a1 = b1 AND a2 > b2) OR … (a1 = b1 AND a2 = b2 AND … ai = bi AND ai+1 > bi+1)
 The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
 Example,
 Given candidate set 2,3,6,7 and target 7,
 A solution set is:

 [2, 2, 3]
 [7]

Solution Outline:
	0. Let f(C, target, prefix) be a function that recursively computes if `target` can be achieved using elements from C.
		prefix : list of numbers so far that adds upto (actual_target - target)
	1. At each level, check if C[i] can be added to prefix, reducing the target needed by C[i]
		=> f(C, target-C[i], prefix+C[i])
		=> if target == 0, add prefix as a combination-sum.
	2. Backtrack to higher levels, if `target` sum cannot be achieved by current items in C.
		When backtracked into a level, remove the first item from C, and try f(C[1..], target, prefix)
	3. Initial call: f(C, actual_target, [])


Sample run:
	C: [2,3,4,7]
	target: 7

	L0: f([2,3,4,7], 7, [])
		L1: f([2,3,4,7], 5, [2])

				L3: f([2,3,4,7], 1, [2,2,2])
					L4: f([2,3,4,7], -1, [2,2,2,2])

						<- Overshot target sum

				L3: f([4,7],1, [2,2,2]) and f([7], 1, [2,2,2]) are dead-ends as well
